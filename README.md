ABOUT:

The ArchBSD project focuses on using ArchLinux package manager on the FreeBSD distribution,
to provide optimised, up to date package for FreeBSD users. This project has also chose to
use Gentoo's OpenRC init system as opposed to the default init system used by FreeBSD. Which
personally I think provide a benfit of speeds and features otherwise not present in the current
RC scripts.
